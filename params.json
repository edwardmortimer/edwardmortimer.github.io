{"name":"Edward Mortimer","tagline":"Industrial Designer","body":"### **Primitive**\r\nA Food Production System\r\n\r\nThe agriculture industry is the biggest driver of environmental pressure, habitat change, climate change, toxic emissions and water use, according to a report published by the United Nations Environment Programme in 2010. 70% of the worldâ€™s drinking water is currently used for the irrigation of crops. This has created an emerging opportunity to allow consumers to reduce the carbon and water footprint of their own food and get back in touch with the growing process.\r\n\r\nThe solution is the Primitive food production system. Primitive gives the consumer the ability to sustainably grow their own food with minimal time, experience and resources. It provides consumers with a fresh and constant source of fruit and vegetables, allowing them to offset the costs of food. It does this by removing the need for agricultural runoff, fertilisers, pesticides, packaging and extensive transport.\r\n\r\nThe Primitive system gives users the ability to grow food by simple refilling the tank once a fortnight. Water flows from the tank down into each of the levels to feed the plants water and nutrients using gravity and a mechanical valve. The mechanical valve lets the plants determine how often they are watered and fed. The system has efficient LED lighting incorporated to feed the plants and allow this system to operate anywhere at any time.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
